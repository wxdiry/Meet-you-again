                    It’s kind of weird how you make me act like this, but after all it’s no longer new to me that I
                    feel butterflies in my stomach when my eyes meets yours. But what is the reason why a
                    quirky girl meets a nonchalant person? It’s like I found someone to adore in the worse
                    timing, yet I still stayed when I saw you smiling.                    
                
                </p>

                <p>
                    Somewhere in the haze, an upset expression was etched on my face. And, I was frustrated
                    throughout the cloudy afternoon. I have known that I always give my all when it comes to
                    multiple tasks. Maybe, just a little bit wrong or in the most troublesome way. Why though?
                    Simply because I was into foolish things lately.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon seeing a new figure standing before me, my eyebrows furrowed due to the familiarity.
                    “I think I’ve met this person before” I thought myself as I continue to stare at him. As his
                    soft gaze meets mine, I look away shyly as a shiver runs down my spine. As my friend’s
                    voice reverberates through the noisy place, we started to play like our childhood days. As
                    the sun slowly sets over the horizon, I was so certain that we wouldn’t see each other
                    again.
                    
                <p>
                    “How foolish I am?” I asked myself as I saw him in front of me. My mind paces back and
                    forth like a ghost as I was staggered by his sudden appearance. At that time I feel the air
                    leave my lungs, as my words were barely comprehensible. My voice came out as a whisper
                    while I was telling a story to my friend. As you lean your head forward to listen to us, I look
                    into your eyes and I saw an utopia. 
                <p>
                    The stars are now displayed on the dark night sky, along with the gentle yet cold breeze.
                    With my lips curve into a smile, I looked at my best friend as I continue to stare at her for
                    awhile. But, as if someone can read my mind I can suddenly feel your presence in front of
                    me. I turn my head to glance at you, and even though your back is facing me it surprised me
                    when I can still recognize you. It’s quite mysterious that you can make me react like this, it
                    feels like I’m in an infinite void of bliss.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I frantically walked around as I tried to think of a solution for this irksome project. Yet, I
                    immediately turned to look at my friend due to his shocking suggestion. “Him? For my
                    project? That isn’t a good idea.” but the next day, as if my body moved on it’s own it was
                    quite unexpected that I will go far for this task. The color drained from my face as I stare at
                    your declination. I have expected that this would happen, however I can’t deny that I was
                    saddened.
                    
                <p>
                    As the months past by, I have completely forgotten about you. My day began like any other
                    day as I go on about my daily life. I ignore the infuriating noises that has been simmering for
                    weeks. I know that Life is cruel and it’s like the flashing lights that will blind you. As the day
                    ends, I drag myself to bed, as I let it all go straight to my head.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No one has ever made an appearance in my dreams before. So, It was quite laughable
                    when you presented yourself in one while I sleep solemnly throughout the desolate night. It
                    was only a peaceful game of hide-and-seek, I was the seeker, while the others went into
                    hiding. As I look around the place, my eyes caught yours and it felt like the whole world took
                    a paused as I continue to stare at your figure from the distance. I can’t let go of the sight in
                    front of me, yet reality held onto me tightly
                <p>
                    As the golden sunlight shines upon my skin, the astonished look is evident on my face. We
                    have only seen each other thrice, therefore it caused such a strike. A great number of
                    questions raced inside my head. Sadly, it remained unanswered up to this day. But it felt so
                    good, as I’ve never felt so alive and happy.
                    
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I gaze at my phone, I was amazed by the sudden information I have. A few years back,
                    we were in the same class. Our class picture along with our Teachers, it’s a bit confusing on
                    how I have a few memory of you. Yet, you can’t seem to remember me. I shook the sadness
                    away, thus even though you don’t have a single memory of me I can’t help but to let a smile
                    appear on my face
                    
                </p>

                <p>
                    My drowsy eyes scans the unknown place in front of me as it caught me of guard due to the
                    large number of people standing before me. Thus, in the midst of the crowds I saw your
                    figure walking with a quick pace. My heart starts beats like footsteps on the ground. For the
                    past few months that I have not seen you, this is such an unfortunate way to get a glimpse
                    of you. Yet, I walked past you with a blush on my cheeks, that was the closest I can get to
                    you

                </p>
                <p>
                    I was suddenly taken aback by the action I did. A keychain in my hand that I bought and a
                    strong feeling for you, along with the rush of confidence, all of it felt new. This chance only
                    comes once in a lifetime. Yet, doubt and shyness got the best of me. Perhaps that is the
                    reason I have failed to approach you in person.

                </p>
                <p>
                    As the night sets upon the city, I was hesitant to send you a message. Thus, I gathered all
                    the courage I have as I knew that there would be no damage. To have a conversation with
                    you was truly whimsical. I am completely aware that I would be a mess the second I
                    realized my incautious actions. Yet, I’m speechless to the point that I didn’t even noticed
                    how confident I am when I had a talked with you.
                    
                    
                </p>

                <p>
                    The small interactions we had was enough to keep me up all night. It made me want to
                    dance all by myself. It was enchanting that I finally saw you again after all these years and
                    months. From the distance, I could see it all begin. This was such a breathtaking way to
                    meet you again.
                </p>
